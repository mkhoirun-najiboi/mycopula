# ROTATED COPULA
We add counterclockwise rotated copula for Archimedean family.

## What's news?
- add Rotated copula (90, 180, and 270 degrees)
- add other marginal distributions (Gamma, Weibull)
- Hypothesis test for marginal distribution (Anderson-Darling) and copula (Cramer-von Mises)

## What's in here?
This script include 4 marginal continuous univariate distribution and 1 marginal discrete univariate distribution.
- Continuous distributions: GEV, Gamma, Lognormal, Weibull
- Discrete distribution: Negative binomial

and include 9 Archimedean copulas:
- one-parameter: Clayton, Frank, Gumbel, Joe, Galambos copulas
- two-parameter: BB1, BB6, BB7, and BB8 copulas

with counterclockwise rotation.
