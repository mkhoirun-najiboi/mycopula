# Getting Started

mycopula is a routine in MATLAB that is prepared to carry out the computational process on copula-based modeling.

Some of the computing processes include Marginal Distribution Fittings, Copula Function Fittings, Visualization of Two Dimensional Copulas, and Regression Process.

The marginal distribution functions used are

- Continuous: Extreme Value, Generalized Extreme Value, Logistic, Normal, Exponential, Gamma, Inverse Gaussian, Log logistic, Lognormal, and Weibull distributions.
- Discrete: Negative Binomial distribution.

The copula functions used are Gaussian, t-student, Gumbel, Frank, Clayton, Joe, Galambos, BB1, BB6, BB7, and BB8.
